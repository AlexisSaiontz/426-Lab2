# 426-Lab2
This assignment was worked on by Alexis Saiontz and Stylianos Rousoglou.
Stelios primarily focused on the log functionality, including storing log
entries and playing the log forward upon normal startup. Alex worked on the
checkpoint command, including the development and implementation of the 
protocol used to persistently store the graph in the checkpoint area.
